            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-4">Types of Data Collected</h3>
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mt-4">Personal Data</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4">We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you (that is, your name, address, telephone number, or email address), unless you choose to provide it to us. We do not knowingly process any provided personal information for any purpose, nor do we share it with any third parties.</p>
            <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 mt-4">Usage Data</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4">Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4">When you project a vector, we collect information like your accuracy, the time you submitted the vector, and the original vector you projected.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4">When you create an account, we collect information like your username and password.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8">Security of Your Personal Data</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4">The security of your Personal Data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4">We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. We never store passwords in plain text (we use one-way encryption with 16 salt rounds to store passwords). All of our servers are protected by a firewall and are monitored for unauthorized access. Rate limiting is used to prevent brute force attacks. We also use a variety of other security measures, including encryption and authentication tools to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8">Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4">Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children").</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4">We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-lg mt-4">If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.</p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8">
                Exporting Your Data
