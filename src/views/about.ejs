            <p class="text-gray-600">LAMP <span class="italic">(Linear Algebra Multiplayer Projection)</span> is a
                multiplayer game where you compete with others worldwide to project a vector onto another vector. It was
                created by <a href="https://hi.williamvongphanith.com" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">William
                    Vongphanith</a> for Mr. Honner's Linear Algebra final project.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-gray-600">The game is written in <a href="https://nodejs.org"
                                                               class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Node.js</a> and <a
                        href="https://expressjs.com" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Express</a> on the backend
                and <a href="https://ejs.co" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">EJS</a> on the frontend. The game is
                hosted on <a href="https://oracle.com" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">Oracle Cloud</a> and uses
                <a href="https://www.mongodb.com" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">MongoDB</a> for data storage.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-gray-600">The backend linear algebra library and the frontend graphing UI canvas library were
                both written from scratch by me. While it isn't used, I wrote a matrix class for the backend as well.
                You're free to use any of the code in this project for your own projects, but please give credit where
                credit is due.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="text-gray-600">The game is open source and can be found on <a
